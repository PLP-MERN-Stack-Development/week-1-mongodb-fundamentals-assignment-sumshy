This project demonstrates the use of MongoDB in building a simple bookstore data layer as part of the PLP MERN Stack Week 1 assignment. The goal was to understand MongoDB fundamentals, including data modeling, CRUD operations, advanced queries, aggregation, and indexing. I used MongoDB Atlas to create a free cloud-hosted database cluster. After setting up my project folder locally, I initialized Node.js and installed the mongodb driver. I then created a script called insert_books.js that connects to my Atlas cluster and inserts over 10 structured book documents into a collection named books under the plp_bookstore database. To run the script, I replaced the placeholder URI with my actual connection string, then executed node insert_books.js in the terminal. Once the data was inserted, I created a queries.js file containing MongoDB queries to meet all task requirements. These included basic CRUD operations such as finding books by genre or author, updating book prices, and deleting books by title. I also implemented advanced queries to find books in stock after 2010, project only select fields (title, author, price), sort books by price in both directions, and paginate results using limit and skip. For data analysis, I wrote aggregation pipelines to calculate the average price of books by genre, identify the most prolific author, and group books by decade of publication. To improve performance, I created indexes on the title field and a compound index on author and published_year, and used the .explain("executionStats") method to confirm that queries utilized indexes rather than full collection scans. All queries were tested using both the MongoDB Atlas UI and the mongosh shell. The final submission includes the insert_books.js script, queries.js file, a README.md, and a screenshot of the database collection in Atlas to demonstrate successful data insertion.
